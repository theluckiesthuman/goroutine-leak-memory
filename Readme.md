In this code, we import the "runtime" package and use runtime.NumGoroutine() to get the number of active goroutines. By monitoring the number of goroutines over time, you can detect if goroutines are leaking. A continuously increasing number of goroutines indicates a potential goroutine leak and a potential memory leak. By combining these code examples with the mentioned techniques like unit testing, profiling, heap analysis, static analysis, and third-party tools, you can effectively detect and resolve memory leaks in your Golang applications.
